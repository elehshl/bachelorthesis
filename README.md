## Thesis

### Let's get started
1. Download the repository as zip
2. Open the zip file in a latex editor. (How to make Latex ready for use can be found [here](https://www.wwu.edu/faculty/curgus/Courses/LaTeX/Getting_Started_with_LaTeX.html). Our recommendation: use the web-based [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/bachelorthesis-hshl/bydmpbhxfqgq)).
3. Choose main.tex as main document, that means compile main.tex. The following pdf should open:

4. Now make changes in the main.tex from line 3-15. In the comments of the file is written, what is to be entered where.
5. In the main.tex of time 68-57 you should adjust the affidavit for you. Add your name to lines 70 and 75.
6. 


### Make Changes in the Document
- **List of Abbreviations:** If you need a list of abbreviations, you can use it in main.tex from line 38-43. If you don't need it, you can delete it or comment it out.
In the list of abbreviations only those abbreviations are shown which are used in the text. Use in the text looks like this: \ac{abbreviation}
- **Add or delete chapters:** In the main.tex you will find from line 47-54 the inclusion of the chapters. There you can add or delete chapters. If you want to add a chapter here, you should also create a new .tex file in the "Chapters" folder and refer to it in main.tex.
